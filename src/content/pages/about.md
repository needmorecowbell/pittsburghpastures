Hello everyone, my name is Nash Lawrence. I am a Mars Pennsylvania lifetime resident and a farmer at heart. I have worked on farms for many years, starting out working for Harvest Valley Farms and then traveling out of state to work at others just absorbing as much information and techniques as I could to start my own.

This summer I started Pittsburgh Pastures with the goal of producing pasture raised chickens and turkeys for locals who want to know where and who from their food is coming from. It’s been alot of work to get through my first batches but am proud to see and hear people enjoying something I’ve raised.

More to come – currently in Lily’s at River forest country club and will soon be in Harvest Valley Farms Market and others.

Thanks again!

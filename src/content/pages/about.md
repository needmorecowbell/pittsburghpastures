Nash Lawrence, the owner and operator of Pittsburgh Pastures, is a lifetime resident of Mars, Pennsylvania. Nash discovered his passion for farming while working at Harvest Valley Farms in Valencia, PA, for six years during his schooling years.

After graduating from Mars High School in 2018, Nash embarked on numerous adventures across the United States. These experiences included herding sheep in Vermont, leading dog sled tours in Minnesota, and working as a livestock manager at a non-profit farm outside of Philadelphia.

Despite these ventures, his love for Western Pennsylvania, particularly his hometown of Mars, led him back to the region to fulfill one of his dreams: farming his own livestock.

In April 2023, Pittsburgh Pastures was born. Located on farmland in Mars, the farm boasts mobile chicken coops on pasture land. Our chickens enjoy a wholesome local diet to supplement the untreated pasture grass. We raise our livestock without added hormones or medications, ensuring natural and healthy produce.

Pittsburgh Pastures' long-term goal is to become a leading provider of fresh chicken to local restaurants and residents of the region. As you dine at local restaurants or visit farmers' markets, keep an eye out for meat from Pittsburgh Pastures.

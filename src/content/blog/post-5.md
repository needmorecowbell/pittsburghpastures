# Example Blog Post

## How to build

This is markdown content, found in `/src/content/blog/post-5.md` of this repository. To make a new post, copy the file and paste it as a new file in the same directory -- ie, `/src/content/blog/post-6.md`. Then, update the values inside and write the post. 

## Running locally

- `npm run dev`

## Deploying

1. you'll need to build the latest changes once you've created them: `npm run build`, which will create a folder called `dist`. This is what needs to be uploaded to wherever the site is being hosted (currently cloudflare)
